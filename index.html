    <ul>
      <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Kosher salt&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1 cup arborio rice</li>
      <li>&nbsp;2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (2 ounces)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded fontina cheese (2 ounces)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2 large eggs&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring the broth and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice, reduce the heat to low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool completely.</li>
      <li>Combine the pine nuts, mozzarella, fontina and parsley in a bowl; set aside.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then stir in the cooled rice, the parmesan and 2/3 cup breadcrumbs. Shape the mixture into sixteen 1 1/2-inch balls.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Put the remaining breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl. Press your finger into the center of each rice ball, insert 2 teaspoons of the mozzarella mixture, then pinch the rice around the filling to enclose. Roll the balls in the breadcrumbs and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Loosely cover and refrigerate, at least 1 hour or overnight. (If refrigerating overnight, roll in more breadcrumbs before frying.)</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the rice balls, turning, until golden brown on all sides, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; season with salt.</li>

<h2 class="article-head">Butternut Squash Ravioli&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>The perfect carb meal using seasonal squash filling for the best fall pasta dish.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>500g all-purpose flour&nbsp;</li>
      <li>500g semolina flour&nbsp;</li>
      <li>5 eggs&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Olive oil, just a dash Salt&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Filling: 2 large butternut squash&nbsp;</li>
      <li>125g butter&nbsp;</li>
      <li>50g brown sugar&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Salt and fresh cracked pepper&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1 whole onion&nbsp;</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1 sprig fresh sage&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Olive oil, just a dash &nbsp;</li>
<li>150g fresh ricotta</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>For the pasta dough: Mix both flours together in a bowl. Make a fountain in the center and add the eggs, olive oil and some salt. Mix with your hands, adding just enough water for the dough to bind. You want to have a ball of dough that is fairly hard and a little dry, so add very little water. Cover with a towel and let set for an hour or so.</li>
      <li>For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the butternut in half lengthwise and lay the squash on a baking sheet. Take 100g of the butter and divide it among each cavity of the squash. Sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until it starts to brown and the squash are soft to the tip of a knife, about 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;With a large spoon, scrape the squash off the skin into a bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Dice the onion about 1/8 inch; chop the garlic and thinly cut the sage.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;In a large saucepan on medium heat, heat up the olive oil. Add the onion and saute until golden brown. Then add the garlic and sage and sweat a little longer. Add the squash, season with salt and pepper and cook on medium heat until it has the consistency of a puree. Move to a food processor and pulse briefly to remove the large chunks.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;In a bowl, add the ricotta, season with salt and pepper and add to the squash puree. Fill a piping bag with the filling. </li>
      <li>&nbsp;Roll the dough with your pasta machine. Using a ravioli mold, fill each ravioli with the butternut squash filling.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Cook the ravioli in a large saucepot with plenty of boiling salted water. Then saute in the remaining butter. Enjoy.</li>

<h2 class="article-head">Veal Milanese&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;A beautiful breaded veal cutlet with the delicious side of potatoes.</p>
    <img src="img/vealmilanese.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="feature-image">
    <ul>
      <li>For cutlets: Veal loin 2 ¼ lbs (1 kg)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Eggs 4 - large&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Breadcrumbs 2 ¼ cups (300 g)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Clarified butter 1 ⅓ cup (300 g)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Maldon salt to taste</li>
      <li>For potatoes: Grated potatoes 1 lb (500 g)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Clarified butter ½ cup (100 g)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Rosemary 1 sprig&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Fine salt to taste Black pepper to taste&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Garlic 1 clove</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>To prepare Veal Milanese (Breaded veal cutlet), first of all, cut the veal loin into cutlets. To do this, cut the meat by inserting the knife between the bones  to make 4 cutlets of about half a pound (250 g) each . At this point scratch the bone with the tip of a knife  to clean the skin off completely. Otherwise the bone handle would darken during cooking and not become lighter thanks to the hot butter.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Set aside the meat and prepare the eggs. Break them into a bowl  and mix them slightly with a whip , without breaking them up too much. If they're small, add another one. Put the breadcrumbs into a large bowl. Take the cutlets by the bone and first dip them in the breadcrumbs ,</li>
      <li>&nbsp;hen dip them in the eggs  and again in the breadcrumbs, pressing well with your hands so that the breadcrumbs stick better . Make a double breading by dipping the cutlets again in the eggs.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;And again in breadcrumbs, pressing well but without flattening the meat too much . Repeat this operation for all the cutlets, then using the flat side of the blade of a knife, tap the slices to even out and set the breadcrumbs . Finally, with the dull edge of the blade, make a sort of grid on the ribs by first pressing horizontal lines.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Then get your vegetable slicer and a bowl full of water. Make slices about 1/10" (2-3 mm) thick  and gradually transfer them into the bowl filled with water ; this way they will release some starch but will not oxidize. Put some water in a pan, salt it and bring it to a boil. Then drain the potatoes and pour them into the water . </li>
      <li>&nbsp;lanch them for about 90 seconds a half minutes then drain them again and cool them slightly under cold water jet . This precooking will reduce the cooking time in butter. Dry the potatoes with a dish towel  and in the meantime heat a large saucepan. Add the clarified butter  and let it melt. </li>
      <li>&nbsp;As soon as it is hot but not too hot, place the cutlets, making sure that the part with the lines is in contact with the pan . After about 4 minutes, the cutlets will be well browned, then turn them  and with a spoon collect some cooking fat and sprinkle it on the rib bone ; this way there will be no bloody streaks and you will get a clear bone. Cutlets will have to cook for about another 4 minutes, this time depends on the thickness of the cut and you will want a pinkish meat inside.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;When cutlets are ready, using a pair of tongs, transfer them to a plate with absorbent paper and again with a sheet of paper gently dab , to eliminate the excess fat. At this point everything is ready, all you have left to do is put them on a plate. Place the potatoes on the side of the plate, near the cutlet and season with maldon salt . Serve your Milanese cutlet hot .</li>

<h2 class="article-head">Pistachio-Almond Biscotti&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>A wonderful Italian, hard shell dessert filled with delicious ricotta filling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Pinch salt&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1, zest grated lemon&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2 large eggs&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2/3 cups slivered almonds&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1/3 cup shelled pistachio nuts&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon anise seeds</li>
    </ul>
<ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, salt and lemon zest and beat just until combined. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as necessary.</li>
      <li>Add the nuts and anise seeds and mix until combined. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a 12-inch-long log. Transfer the log to the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Leave the oven on. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut the log on the diagonal into 1/2 -inch-thick slices. Place the biscotti cut side up on the lined baking sheet and bake for an additional 12 to 14 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Cool completely on a wire rack. Store the biscotti in an airtight container in a cool dry place for up to 2 weeks.</li>
